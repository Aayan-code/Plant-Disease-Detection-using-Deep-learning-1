# üçÖ Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning (ResNet50)

## üìò Overview
This project applies **Transfer Learning** using a pre-trained **ResNet50** CNN to classify tomato leaf diseases into **9 categories**.  
The fine-tuned model achieves **98.7% test accuracy**, enabling early detection of plant diseases to support **smart and sustainable agriculture**.  

This work is part of the **HIT401 Capstone Project** at **Charles Darwin University**.

Execution Steps
1Ô∏è. Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https:https://github.com/Aayan-code/Plant-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-learning-1
2. Set Up Environment
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add Dataset

Dataset of Tomato Leaves.
If the dataset is large, upload it via Google Drive and link it in this README.

4. Train Model
python train_model.py


or in Jupyter:

!jupyter notebook tomato0.ipynb

5. Fine-Tune ResNet50

Unfreeze the top 30 layers for fine-tuning:

for layer in base_model.layers[-30:]:
    layer.trainable = True

6. Evaluate Model
python evaluate_model.py


This will display:
